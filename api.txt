Description

The API for our program (types, etc are in project DOCX); please follow these CURD-based (create, update, read, delete) function, method, and variable names so the modules will interact. Just say no to camels!

Properties

With redundant, anti-pattern setters/getters, sadly; perhaps we can add bounds checks to the setters to make them meaningful (eg, only letters allowed in names, 0–100 for grades)? Otherwise they're just implementing a private var as a public var!

[**var**: setter, getter]

**id**: update_id(), read_id()
**first_name**: update_first_name(), read_first_name()
**last_name**: update_last_name(), read_last_name()
**ssn**: update_ssn(), read_ssn()
**grades**: update_grades(), read_grades()
**average_grade**: update_average_grade(), read_average_grade()

Methods

• create_average_grade()
• output_details() (outputs directly, as per name)

Methods

...
• create_students() (Put file IO in this step for simplicity as we won't be adding more students from files later)
• update_students_order_by_average_grade()
• update_students_order_by_last_name()
• create_class_average_grade()
• output_class_details() (call output_details() on students; outputs directly, as per name)
• read_student_count()
