Welcome

Welcome to the project readme for our team, tentatively named Team C! This will be our "home base" for the CSC 134 group project and todo list. I will try to keep most of the key information here because we have such a small group. However, as needed, I will break out some content into other files/folders; do not modify anything outside of your scope, please.

Keep in mind that this is a public repo so we won't be posting any e-mail addresses, links to our other collaboration tools, etc. But by doing the majority of our work in the open on Git, we will not only have better control of versioning but something we can all share in the future on a résumé; I plan to keep this repo open and public indefinitely.

Ground Rules

For now, because the group is so small, I am going to give everyone commit privileges; please avoid pull requests unless you are merging a branch with conflicts. Here are the general ground rules we'll be observing:

1. Respect others.
2. Respect others's work.
3. Respect the group roles and hierarchy.
4. Respect the project and goals.
5. Respect everyone's time—including your own.
